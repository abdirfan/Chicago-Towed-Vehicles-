# Description
The Chicago Towed Vehicles dataset (https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Towed-Vehicles/ygr5-vcbg) displays information for vehicles that have been towed and impounded by the City of Chicago within the last 90 days. It includes information such as the make, model, and plate of the vehicle, when it was towed, where it was towed to, etc.

Looking at this bar chart, we can see that the 701 N. Sacremento had the highest amount of cars towed out of any location with 10300 S. Doty Coming in at a close second.

We can see from this line graph that the amount of cars towed steadily increased in the span of 3 months. We can see some spikes/outliers in the graph in mid september, maybe due to Labor Day Weekend. There is also a spike at the end of October, maybe due to any Halloween events held.

After using this multiple line graph to see the amount of cars towed at each location over time we have found that overall the amount of cars towed at each location besides O'Hare are quite equal. If not for the one outlier raising Sacremento's count by 70.

In this pie chart that visualizes the distribution of towed vehicle makes, we can see that the most frequently towed vehicles are also generally the most best-selling car brands such as Chevy, Ford, Hyundai, Toyota, etc. However, even though Toyota is the top selling brand in America, Chevys and Fords tend to get towed more. This could be due to their inherent historic strength and prevalence in the Midwest. Luxury and high-end makes such as Mercedes, Lexus, Audi, etc are towed more infrequently likely because there are far fewer of them on the road.

In these bar graphs, we are comparing the top 10 makes that get towed the most frequently in 10300 S. Doty and 701 N. Sacramento. Comparing the two, we can see that Chevys are towed the most frequently across both locations. A notable difference between the two locations is that Toyotas are the 2nd most frequently towed make at 701 N. Sacramento while Toyotas are outside the top 5 frequent makes towed at 10300 S. Doty. This could mean there's a larger presence of Toyotas in the areas surrounding 701 N. Sacramento. Also, both graphs show Chrysler is the least towed make which could be interpreted as there's less sales of Chrysler compared to other car brands or possibly just less Chryslers in the area - potentially due to lack of dealerships or lack of interest in purchasing Chryslers.

This heatmap is an alternative to a simple bar chart, and explores where vehicles that are towed in Chicago originate from (according to their license plates). As expected, the overwhelming majority are from Illinois, with the neighboring states of Indiana and Wisconsin coming in at second and third and other Midwestern states not far behind. There's also a noticable amount of California, Texas, and Florida plates, probably because they have very large populations.
